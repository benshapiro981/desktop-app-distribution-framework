# desktop-app-distribution-framework
Website and desktop app framework.  Meant as a proof-of-concept full-stack project that features a website where the user can make an account, subscribe to the service, download an obfuscated python desktop app, and authenticate to the app using the account they made on the website.  Reusable for a project/business to distribute desktop app.
